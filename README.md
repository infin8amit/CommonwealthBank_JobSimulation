# InsightSpark Analysis and Data Management Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing data, anonymizing sensitive information, utilizing social media data for insights, and proposing a structured database for storing Twitter data. The tasks are divided into four main areas: data analysis, data anonymization, social media data exploration, and database proposal.

## Task 1: Data Analysis
Analyze the provided CSV dataset to answer the following questions:

### Questions and Solutions
1. **Apples Purchased in Cash Across Locations:**
   - **Question:** How many apples were purchased in cash?
   - **Solution:** Perform a filter operation on the dataset to count the number of apple purchases made with cash.

2. **Total Cash Spent on Apples:**
   - **Question:** How much total cash was spent on these apples?
   - **Solution:** Calculate the total amount spent on apple purchases made in cash.

3. **Spending at Bakershire by Non-Member Customers:**
   - **Question:** Across all payment methods, how much money was spent at the Bakershire store location by non-member customers?
   - **Solution:** Filter the dataset to include only transactions at the Bakershire store by non-member customers and sum the total spending.

## Task 2: Data Anonymization
Anonymize the provided dataset to ensure the protection of personal details. This involves using anonymization techniques such as removing unnecessary columns, masking identifying information, and categorizing sensitive figures.

### Anonymization Steps
1. **Remove Unnecessary Columns:**
   - Identify and remove columns that are not essential for analysis but may contain personal information.

2. **Mask Identifying Information:**
   - Apply masking techniques to columns that contain sensitive information such as names or IDs.

3. **Categorize Sensitive Figures:**
   - Group sensitive numerical data into categories to prevent individual identification.

### Output
Submit the anonymized data as a CSV file.
